Yep, SmileysScript now has documentation.

Currently, the documentation is very bare bones, with just a basic getting started guide and simple language refrence.  But I have big plans for it!

## Future of The Documentation

This documentation will expand as the language expands.  With the refracturing planned for v0.0.2, I am afraid their won't be many new features then, but don't fret, many new features are coming!

Also, these docs will likely become versioned after v0.1.0, though that is not set in stone yet.  It may be all versions are saved, it may be patches/minor/major versions are saved, it may be no versions are saved.  We will just have to see how this documentation grows over time.
