Your Privacy is very important to us.  That is why we use an open source tracker (Matomo) that is self-hosted and ethically managed rather than Google Analytics.  All IPs are anonymized for anonymity.

## Usage of Data

All data collected will not be sold or used for profit by the SmileysScript team.  It will simply be used for understanding commonly visited parts of the documentation.  This allows us to see common issues people have, among other things.

## What is tracked?

Currently, usage data, device data, searches, and origin are all tracked anonymously.  Cookies are used to track across pages and sessions, allowing us to see common pages seen together.

## Information Security

All info is stored on our own stack, meaning no third party has it.  All information is secured according to all governmental standards.

## Updating

While unlikely, our usage of your data may change.  If it will, the usage of your anonymized IP will not be included in the change.  Any changes will be posted here before the action, and all changes will group past data rather than having individual reports.
