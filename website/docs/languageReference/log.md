The log system is currently being reworked.

:::


Logging is extremely important.  That is why it is one of the oldest features of the language!

## Structure

Logging is structured into two parts.  The first is the `ðŸ˜œ` emoji.  Then you must have a space.  After that, you put the word you want to print.  Currently, there are no spaces allowed.

## Examples

```
ðŸ˜œ Hello!
```

```
ðŸ˜œ Error!
```
