## Installation

Thanks to npm, installing SmileysScript is easy as Ï€.

Just run the following command in a NodeJS package!

`npm i --save-dev smileysscript`

## First File!

Now lets create our first SmileysScript file!  First, lets go create a `src` folder (if you haven't yet) and enter it!

Create a file named `helloWorld.ðŸ˜€`

That's right, all files in SmileysScript have a smile right in their filename!

:::note

If your computer doesn't like the emoji in the file name, using `.smiley` is a less fun alternative.

:::

Open up that file in your favorite text editor.

First we have to add the `ðŸ˜€` to the beginning of the program.  For now that is just the rule.  In the future it may become more useful.

Now add `ðŸ˜œ Hello ðŸ˜œ World!`.  This will print out the words `Hello` and `World!` to the window.

Your file should now look like this:

`ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜œ Hello ðŸ˜œ World!`

Great Job!  You made your first SmileysScript Program!

## Compile and Run Your First File

Now we have to compile your file to JavaScript and execute it.  Go to the head of you NodeJS package and run:

`npx smileysscript`

This compiles all SmileysScript files in the input directory and puts the JavaScript files in the Output directory.  Since the input directory is `src` by default, you don't have to worry about changing it!

Now the file is compiled into JavaScript and stored in your `lib` directory, which is the default location.  Simply run `node lib/helloWorld.js` to run the compiled file!
